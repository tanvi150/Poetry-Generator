# 🌼 Mother's Day Poetry Generator

This poetry generator was made with love for Mother's Day 💛. 
It combines creative coding, user interaction, and generative design.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as a personal gift for Mother's Day — blending technology and creativity to generate unique, heartfelt poems. 
It also serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating my front-end development and generative design skills.

## ✨ Features

- 🗂️ **Word Theme Selector** – Users can mix 1–5 words from various themes
- ✍️ **Poem Generation Engine** – Uses JavaScript (p5.js) to dynamically construct and render the poem
- 🎨 **Responsive Design** – Styled with CSS to adapt across screen sizes
- 🌸 **Mother’s Day Theme** – Soft visuals and gentle UX to evoke emotion
